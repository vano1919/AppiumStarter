AppiumStarter Framework

Overview:
AppiumStarter is a framework for kickstarting mobile automation projects using Appium. It employs the Page Object Model (POM) pattern and custom methods with dynamic waits to ensure stability in your tests.

**It Has Defaukt Implementations of TESTtest to check framework works.**

**I Will Develop My own Tests On another Branches**


Key Features:

Page Object Model (POM):
Organizes mobile app pages into separate classes for better code maintenance.
Encourages reuse of page elements and actions across tests.

Custom Methods with Dynamic Waits:
Provides custom methods for interacting with mobile elements, enhancing test stability.
Implements dynamic waits to ensure tests proceed only after expected conditions are met.

Ready-to-Use Starter Project:
Offers a pre-configured framework setup, enabling immediate test creation.
Saves time in setting up the initial project structure.Getting Started:
